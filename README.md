# Moroccan-Databases
Moroccan Databases are scattered over the web. This is a humble attempt to gather them in one repo. **Feel free to join** :)

## Website
[Click here to access the website](https://moroccodata.netlify.app/).

Note: if the above link doesn't work, it means that the website is in deployment. Please try www.moroccodata.com instead. If both don't work, please retry in 24 to 48 hours (domain configuration can take some time). If after 48 hours the website don't work, please email databasemorocco@gmail.com. Thanks.

Note to devs: A custom "page not found" route has been set with react-router-dom. It works on localhost but not on production with netlify. It's possible that netlify overwrites it and the page not found requires additional setting which will be done after the migration on the new domain name aka www.moroccodata.com.

Also, feel free to improve the website and share the repo/website :)

## Why contribute
Through many initiatives such as [the new development model](https://www.hcp.ma/Nouveau-modele-de-developpement_r594.html), Morocco has expressed its interest in bringing data in the center of its decisions and improving the country's R&D. Centralising data in one place can reveal a lot about the untapped potential of Morocco. This is an attempt to discover the root causes of problems in order to identify appropriate solutions. Whether you're an activist, an entrepreneur, a financial analyst or just a curious person, we hope that you fill find value in this repo and share your insights with others.

## How to contribute
- Include in README.md any database/dataset related to Morocco. If you created your own dataset, include it as well and explain how you created it (i.e. source of the data, scraper's script, etc.).
- Include websites that could be used for web scraping.
- Any other idea? Go for it!
