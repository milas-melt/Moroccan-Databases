## Why contribute
Through many initiatives such as [the new development model](https://www.hcp.ma/Nouveau-modele-de-developpement_r594.html), Morocco has expressed its interest in bringing data in the center of its decisions and improving the country's R&D. Centralising data in one place can reveal a lot about the untapped potential of Morocco. This is an attempt to discover the root causes of problems in order to identify appropriate solutions. Whether you're an activist, an entrepreneur, a financial analyst or just a curious person, we hope that you fill find value in this repo and share your insights with others.

## How to contribute
- Include in README.md any database/dataset related to Morocco. If you created your own dataset, include it as well and explain how you created it (i.e. source of the data, scraper's script, etc.).
- Include websites that could be used for web scraping.
- Any other idea? Go for it!
